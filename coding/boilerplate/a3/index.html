<div>
  <p>For this Browser-based Interactive Project I chose to pair the playful adjective with the design principle of feedback to create an interaction.
    My browser interaction came to life as an experimental art piece. It is a very simple and fun interaction which encourages playful exploration through feedback response to clickable elements on the page.
    
    The text on the page welcomes the user to the interaction and gives a personalised preface with a playful expression. The webpage is referred to as ‘my house’ and invites the user in with instructions to enter via the ‘correct’ door. This is a misleading statement as no doors or elements take you anywhere else. This interaction is designed in this way to be slightly frustrating and a tease for complete engagement with the feedback responses. 
    As J. Murray outlines in Inventing the Medium: Principles of Interaction Design as a Cultural Practice, “In interface design, feedback refers to the signal the machine returns to the user as the result of a user action” (2012). This was communicated within my interaction in a number of ways. At the most intrinsic level the cursor returns a feedback signal over items that are responsive to click on. The next feedback occurs by the animation of the doors as they are hovered over- signalling more than anything playful expression and perhaps invitation. The main central feedback occurs at the clicking of elements referred to as doors.
    Some of the elements when clicked become obvious loading bars and others are more abstract versions of load throbbers. This has been designed for visual variety, so that the user may sometimes falsely think they’ve chosen the correct door when it displays a basic loading.
    All elements are animated on an infinite loop to drive the potential that it may in a moment open into the house.
    One of the doors once clicked is a trap door which leads you to another door - adding to the random playful misdirection of the feedback interaction.
    Following the trap door leads you to an element which circles the word door, subtly teasing the allure of the door further.
    The sly message or riddle of this piece is that all doors are actually correct and once they are all open the user is inside their house. The house is the visual display of decorative movement and once no more feedback can be generated and intention to find the correct door has been dropped it’ll hopefully delight the user.
    
    This browser interaction uses a collection of div containers in HTML (a set for the doors and another set for their subsequent load throbbers), that I styled with CSS to manually customise for appropriate visual feedback including animated keyframes for the infinite rotation feedback and animation play state to create motion upon hovering. I created event listeners in Javascript to link together the interacting shapes, organising the disappearing and appearing of elements upon click function.
