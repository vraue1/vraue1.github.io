/* DEFINITIONS & SETUP */

// first let's retrieve references to all the elements we'll need to use
// this is the video itself
let videoElement = document.getElementById("videoElement");
// the buttons for the controls
let playButton = document.getElementById("playButton");
let stopButton = document.getElementById("stopButton");
let muteButton = document.getElementById("muteButton");
let myAudio = document.getElementById("myAudio");
var slider = document.getElementById("volumeSlider")
// the progress element
let progressBar = document.getElementById("progressBar");

// next we remove the controls attribute - we do this with JS rather than just not including it in the HTML tag as a fallback
// this way if the JS doesn't load for whatever reason the player will have the default built in controls
videoElement.removeAttribute("controls");
// then if the default controls are removed we can show our custom controls - we want to do this via JS so that if the JS doesn't
// load then they won't show
document.getElementById("controlsWrapper").style.display = "flex";

// then we listen for the loadedmetadata event to fire which means we'll be able to access exactly how long the piece of media is
// i'm using an arrow function here that updates the progress element's max attribute with the duration of the media
// this way when it comes to setting the progress bars value the number matches a percentage of the total duration
videoElement.addEventListener('loadedmetadata', () => {
  progressBar.setAttribute('max', videoElement.duration);
});

// some mobile devices won't fire a loadedmetadata event so we need a fallback to make sure the attribute is set in these cases - we 
// can do this by also running a check whenever playback starts by using the playing event
videoElement.addEventListener("playing", () => {
  // we can then double check if the attribute has already been set - if not then set it here - ! inside of an if statement flips the 
  // truth of what we're checking for - so (progressBar.getAttribute('max')) would check if there's a value and 
  // (!progressBar.getAttribute('max')) checks if there is no value - ie false
  if (!progressBar.getAttribute('max')){
    progressBar.setAttribute('max', videoElement.duration);
  }
});

/* LOADING */

// here we're adding some feedback to indicate when the video is loading - this is pretty similar to our last experiement in that we're 
// applying an animation via a class. the real difference here is when that class gets added - by listening for the waiting event which 
// fires when the media is waiting to load we can add the animation to the timeline via the .classList.add() method. when we want to 
// stop the animation we listen for the canplay event which fires when the media player has buffered enough data to be able to playback the 
// media then we use the .classList.remove() method - if we instead wanted to wait until it has actually loaded the whole file we could 
// use the canplaythrough event
videoElement.addEventListener("waiting", () => {
  progressBar.classList.add("timeline-loading");
});
videoElement.addEventListener("canplay", () => {
  progressBar.classList.remove("timeline-loading");
});

/* MEDIA FINSIHED */

// when the media finishes we want to make sure that play icon switches back over from pause to indicate that the user can restart playback
videoElement.addEventListener("ended", () => {
  playButton.style.backgroundImage = "url('./icons/play.svg')";
});

/* PLAY/PAUSE */

// we can use the .play() and .pause() methods on our media element to play and pause playback - because I want this to be triggered by 
// two different events (see below) i'm going to write it as a seperate function 
// by combining play and pause into the same function i'm able to make sure it does what i want - if the media is already playing i only 
// ever want use .pause() (as pausing an already paused video doesn't really make sense) 
// the same goes if the media is paused or stopped i only want use .play()
function playPause(){
  // the following if statement checks to see if the media is currently paused OR if the media has finshed playing - || inside of an if 
  // statement like this is how we write an OR conditional, if either of these things are true it'll trigger the block of code
  // the reason we check for both is that when the video finishes playing it'll be in an ended state not a paused state
  if (videoElement.paused || videoElement.ended) {
    // if it isn't already playing make it play
    videoElement.play();
    // then make sure the icon on the button changes to pause indicating what it does if you click it
    playButton.style.backgroundImage = "url('./icons/pause.svg')";
  } else {
    // if it is already playing make it pause
    videoElement.pause();
    // then make sure the icon on the button changes to play indicating what it does if you click it
    playButton.style.backgroundImage = "url('./icons/play.svg')";
  }
}

// now we have our function we need to attach it to two seperate events, the first is probably obvious - clicking on the play button
playButton.addEventListener('click', playPause);

// the second event we want is clicking on the video itself, a feature popularised by youtube that is now ubiquitous in online video players
videoElement.addEventListener('click', playPause);

// this feature is unfinished in my code - while it works it has no signifiers to let users know they can do this by clicking the video
// there is already an element appropriately placed as a signifier, the <img> with the id of videoPlayerOverlay however its CSS is currently
// set to display: none - try to complete this feature by doing the following 
// first you'll need to remove display: none from its css ruleset
// then you'll need to add two new statements to the playPause() function above - each will need to first find the correct element using the 
// document.getElementById() and then update that element's .style.display property to equal either "block" or "none" depending on the context
// if done correctly the play overlay will only appear over the video if paused, otherwise it should disappear when playing


/* TIMELINE */

// there's two different things we want to do with our timeline - update the progress bar to display how much has already played and let the user 
// click the progress bar to scrub the video to a specific place in the video
// to update the progress bar we need to listen for the timeupdate event which is fired everytime the current video time is updated - when the video 
// is playing this repeatedly fires at a constant rate
videoElement.addEventListener('timeupdate', () => {
  // this statement is simple - we update the progress bar's value attribute with the currentTime property of the video, because timeupdate runs everytime
  // currentTime is changed it'll update both as the video plays and if we were to skip or stop the video
  progressBar.value = videoElement.currentTime;
});

// the simplest version of scrubbing would be to update the video's currentTime when the user clicks the timeline - however due to the interaction pattern 
// established by youtube we should also account for a slightly different expression of user agency. the code below will work with a simple click on the 
// timeline but will also allow for a user to drag their mouse on the timeline to continuously update currentTime and only end scrubbing when they release the 
// mouse button. implementing this will take some more complex use of event listeners but i'll do my best to explain the design and technical implementation

// first thing we want to do is write a function that will take the current position of the the mouse in relation to the timeline and use it to change the 
// currentTime property of the video element. each time this runs we'll need to know the position of the mouse so which we'll do using the event passed to it 
// by the eventlistener - to access this we need to set it as a parameter, i've used the name e but it can be called whatever you like
function scrubToTime(e){
  // this statement has a lot going on so let's step through each part:
  // the first thing we want to work out is the distance between the left side of the progress bar and the mouses current position - if we were just building 
  // an interaction to work when the mouse is over the bar we could take this from the event, however as we want this to also work when we've held the mouse 
  // down and moved it somewhere else on the page we need to work this out manually
  // e.clientX is the cursors current distance from the left edge of the page
  // we then want to minus (progressBar.getBoundingClientRect().left + window.scrollX) from this distance to account for any gap between the left edge of the 
  // page and the start of the progress bar
  // videoElement.currentTime is the current position in the media file - we are setting it here to change the playback time
  // we then need to find a normalised 0-1 value based on how far along the bar the cursor is - the idea is that if i click the left most side it should return 0
  // and if i click the right most side it should return 1 - we get this value by dividing x by the total width of the progressBar
  // the value is then fed into our clampZeroOne() function - this is accounting for if our mouse is further left or further right than the ends of the progress bar
  // it works by essentially making the value always equal 1 if it is over 1 or always making it 0 if under 0 - this is commonly called a clamp, we're only allowing
  // a value to be in a certain range
  // finally we're using this clamped value to multiply with total duration of our video thus working out where we should scrub to
  let x = e.clientX - (progressBar.getBoundingClientRect().left + window.scrollX);
  videoElement.currentTime = clampZeroOne(x / progressBar.offsetWidth) * videoElement.duration;
}

// the click event fires only if the user presses the mouse down and then releases it on the same element. we can allow for a wider range of interactions by
// further breaking this down this into its discrete parts and listening to both the mousedown and mouseup events seperately

progressBar.addEventListener('mousedown', scrubToTime);
progressBar.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
  // the behaviour here is to listen to the mousemove event (fired when the user moves their mouse) when the click is held down but then to stop listening to that 
  // event when the mouse click is released
  window.addEventListener('mousemove', scrubToTime);
  window.addEventListener('mouseup', () => {
    window.removeEventListener('mousemove', scrubToTime);
  });
