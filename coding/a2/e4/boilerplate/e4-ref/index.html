  As discussed in class it is important for a user to feel as though they have agency when interacting with a website. In the case of a media player it is providing the appropriate kind of agency for an organised and efficient experience. The most important would be the ability to stop the media at will which was already integrated in this exercise. In addition to the mute button from class I chose to add the feature of a volume slider to this media player. This I believe is a highly important feature that similar to starting and stopping the visual or sonic parts, gives a complete autonomy of listening volume control to the person interacting so that they may adjust for their comfort and feel in control. I then added to css styling and html to adjust theprogress bar of the media player to allow for the kind of control that is culturally expected for a media player and created feedback of a cursor for hovering over all the parts which are responsive.
