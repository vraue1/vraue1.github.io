<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
<h2>Q1 What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2>
<p>Colours, shapes and words</p>
<h2>Q2 Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions</h2>
<p>Clicking, reading, listening, hovering</p>
<h2>Q3 What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2>
<p>Listening and adjusting audio interactions in different configurations</p>
<h2>Q4 What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h2>
<p>Clicking</p>
<h2>Q5 What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h2>
<p>My impression of the intended primary goal is that this website displays works of poetry in a fun contemporary way that may be more engaging that the traditional way of reading poetry and potentially more impactful
</p>
<h2>Q6 What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h2>
<p>I applaud the interactive experience for challenging standard structure. Also for encouraging further exploration by having a unique experience for each poem. For some people it would probably be quite engaging, however its slightly overwhelming for me and I think more or less takes away from the depth and meaning of the words themselves.</p>
<h2>Q7 What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
</h2>
<p>I think the experience requests dynamic interaction. It encourages lots of clicking and reading as most pages have lots of content. Some pages have a multitude of configurations which generate different musical tonalities and I think therefore it requests that you continue playing and creating your own enjoyable musical experience several times over until youve exhausted all potential combinations. This may be somewhere between 1-3 minutes per poem.
</p>
<h2>Q8 What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h2>
<p>I think the interactive experience encourages play and unique input for generative reward. I think the experience asks the user to revisit different parts of the page and click on different elements for continuous engagement and renewed attention to the different poems as they play out.</p>
<h2>Q9 What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h2>
<p>The experience references both immersive digital art as well as early computer games / game boys in its jerky motions and similar tones of sound.</p>
<h2>Q10 What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</h2>
<p>This reference encourages a playful and explorative behaviour when interacting with the website</p>
<h2>Q11 What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h2>
<p>By referencing both an artistic creative mode and a playful nostalgic mode it suggests that the user should feel curious and satisfied and tries to foster a fun openness to hearing and seeing what it has to show you.</p>
<h2>Q12 What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h2>
<p>This interaction becomes frustrating for me quite quickly. I personally find the chaos of all of the interaction to be quite messy and hard to understand any of the content. It feels as though it doesnt foster any intention with exploring, rather just mindless clicking and the result for me is that Iâ€™m reading a mess of words which have no impact as Ive just been thrown around a website.</p>
<h2>Q13 What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h2>
<p>I think the palette of tones across all of the pages of the interaction are all quite pleasant and delightful. They are fortunately not over complicated and in all possible combinations they generate simple and warm melodies.</p>
