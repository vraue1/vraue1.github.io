<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
<h2>Q1 What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2>
<p>Colours and shapes</p>
<h2>Q2 Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions</h2>
<p>Clicking, reading, listening, hovering</p>
<h2>Q3 What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2>
<p>Listening and adjusting audio interactions in different configurations</p>
<h2>Q4 What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h2>
<p>Clicking</p>
<h2>Q5 What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h2>
<p>If the primary goal is for the user to create an interactive musical experience then it is highly effective in doing so</p>
<h2>Q6 What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h2>
<p>I think the experience is highly effective in communicating its primary goal. By generating a simple layout, pleasant colour palette and a bright,pleasing sound loop with matching movement through a simple explorative click it aims to create a pleasing and delightful experience with rewarding impact.
</p>
<h2>Q7 What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
</h2>
<p>I think the experience requests interaction for a fairly short amount of time. This is because the overlapping audio files arent very dynamic and so I feel like I become exhausted by them quite quickly.</p>
<h2>Q8 What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h2>
<p>I think the interactive experience encourages play and unique input for generative reward. I think the experience asks the user to create multiple configurations by revisiting and clicking on different elements so to encourage continuous engagement and attention to the different poems as they play out.
</p>
<h2>Q9 What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h2>
<p>The experience references such things as a virtual musical instrument and a piece of immersive art</p>
<h2>Q10 What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</h2>
<p>This reference encourages a lighthearted and explorative behaviour when interacting with the website, based on interactions that the user creates</p>
<h2>Q11 What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h2>
<p>By referencing a musical instrument where the user is in control of the sound it produces it suggests that the user should feel satisfied and fosters an openness to hearing and seeing what it has to show you</p>
<h2>Q12 What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h2>
<p>This interaction becomes frustrating quite quickly. It doesnt have the capability to advance in structure, change or be dynamic in any way other than within the restraints of its configurations. This becomes quickly fatiguing and repetitive and drives me to disengage.</p>
<h2>Q13 What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h2>
<p>I think the colour schemes of the different interactions are the most satisfying thing. Theyre very pleasing to the eye while also being fairly gentle and soft</p>
